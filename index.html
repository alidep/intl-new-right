                <p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he global surge of right-wing movements has been marked by a blend of anti-globalist, anti-establishment, nationalist, racist, and xenophobic rhetoric, all wrapped in a veneer of traditional values. From India to Europe, Brazil, the United States, and Argentina, these movements are shifting political landscapes, pushing extreme-right ideologies into the mainstream. Even in places where they haven’t seized power, their influence is unmistakable. Political norms are skewing rightward, with once-fringe views increasingly embraced by mainstream parties.
</br></br>
The academic world is still wrestling with how to label this phenomenon, some using terms like neofascism, post-fascism, and radical right, while others suggest new labels like 'neopatriots' or 'extreme-right 2.0.' Despite their nationalist focus, these movements share a strikingly uniform international ideology. They rally against common enemies: globalism, socialism, gender ideology, and what they derisively term 'wokeness.'
</br></br>
As these 'culture wars' spill over national borders, some scholars argue that it is the global nature of these movements that marks them as distinct from past iterations of right-wing extremism."</p>

New right movements tend to argue that global institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations and trade deals, undermine the ability of nations to govern themselves according to their own values and interests. This anti-globalist sentiment is often accompanied by calls to withdraw from international organizations, reassert control over borders, and prioritize national interests over global cooperation.

         <div class="subtitle">Anti Woke</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">A</span> cross the globe, new right movements have turned 'wokeism' into their favorite punching bag—a catch-all slur for anything remotely progressive. What started as 'Stay Woke,' a rallying cry from Black American communities during the Civil Rights Movement, meant to keep folks vigilant about racial and social injustices, has been twisted into a broadside against causes like racial justice, gender equality, and social equity.
</br></br>

The term 'woke' got a new lease on life in the 2010s, thanks to Black Lives Matter activists, expanding beyond race to spotlight issues around gender and other marginalized identities. It caught on with millennials and Gen Z, spreading far and wide, and even landing a spot in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017. But as its global reach grew, so did the backlash—transforming 'woke' from a badge of awareness into a buzzword for the culture wars.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
<div class="textstandard">
<p>'Woke' eventually became co-opted to symbolize perceived excesses of political correctness. This framing presents wokeism as a dire threat to traditional values, national identity, and free speech. The term has transcended its origins, spreading globally as a pejorative. In China, for instance, the term "baizuo," meaning "white left," is used similarly to criticize perceived Western liberalism and social justice advocacy. This global spread of the concept of wokeism has enabled far-right groups to unite diverse factions under a common cause of resisting what they see as leftist cultural dominance, framing their opposition as a defense of national and cultural integrity against foreign and domestic progressive ideologies.

The term "woke" gained traction again in the 2010s, expanding its scope beyond race to encompass issues related to gender and other marginalized identities.
