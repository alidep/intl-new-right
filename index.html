                <p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he global surge of right-wing movements has been marked by a blend of anti-globalist, anti-establishment, nationalist, racist, and xenophobic rhetoric, all wrapped in a veneer of traditional values. From India to Europe, Brazil, the United States, and Argentina, these movements are shifting political landscapes, pushing extreme-right ideologies into the mainstream. Even in places where they haven’t seized power, their influence is unmistakable. Political norms are skewing rightward, with once-fringe views increasingly embraced by mainstream parties.
</br></br>
The academic world is still wrestling with how to label this phenomenon, some using terms like neofascism, post-fascism, and radical right, while others suggest new labels like 'neopatriots' or 'extreme-right 2.0.' Despite their nationalist focus, these movements share a strikingly uniform international ideology. They rally against common enemies: globalism, socialism, gender ideology, and what they derisively term 'wokeness.'
</br></br>
As these 'culture wars' spill over national borders, some scholars argue that it is the global nature of these movements that marks them as distinct from past iterations of right-wing extremism."</p>

New right movements tend to argue that global institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations and trade deals, undermine the ability of nations to govern themselves according to their own values and interests. This anti-globalist sentiment is often accompanied by calls to withdraw from international organizations, reassert control over borders, and prioritize national interests over global cooperation.

         <div class="subtitle">Anti Woke</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">A</span> cross the globe, new right movements have turned 'wokeism' into their favorite punching bag—a catch-all slur for anything remotely progressive during. The term “stay woke” originated within Black American communities civil rights era. It emerged as a call to a call to be conscious of and vigilant of racism and oppression.  It has been twisted into a broadside against causes like racial justice, gender equality, and social equity.
</br></br>

The term 'woke' got a new lease on life in the 2010s, thanks to Black Lives Matter activists, expanding beyond race to spotlight issues around gender and other marginalized identities. It caught on with millennials and Gen Z, spreading far and wide, and even landing a spot in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017. But as its global reach grew, so did the backlash—transforming 'woke' from a badge of awareness into a buzzword for the culture wars.
    </p>
</div>
</div>

  <div class="section">
<div class="textstandard">
<p class="newspaper">'Woke' didn’t just get co-opted; it got weaponized. What once stood for social awareness now symbolizes the so-called 'excesses' of political correctness. Right-wing movements have latched onto this framing, pitching wokeism as a mortal threat to traditional values, national identity, and free speech. The term has spread far beyond its origins, becoming a pejorative in many regions.
</br></br>
This backlash isn’t limited to the West. In China, the sentiment has found a parallel in the term 'baizuo' (白左), or 'white left,' which emerged in the mid-2010s among certain online circles as a way to mock Western liberals, social justice advocates, and those seen as overly politically correct or naive on issues like immigration, race, and gender.
</br></br>
The global spread of 'wokeism' as the enemy has given far-right groups a rallying point, allowing them to unite under a shared mission: push back against what they see as leftist cultural dominance. They’re not just resisting progressivism—they’re framing it as an invasion, a threat to national and cultural integrity that must be fought off, whether the perceived enemy is foreign or domestic.

         <div class="subtitle">Anti-Elites</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">T</span> he anti-elite rhetoric is a central element of the appeal of these new right movements, capitalizing on widespread distrust of political, economic, and cultural elites. Leaders tend to portray themselves as outsiders challenging a corrupt and out-of-touch establishment that has betrayed the interests of the "real" people. This narrative is often intertwined with conspiracy theories that accuse elites of conspiring to maintain power at the expense of the populace, fueling a populist backlash against traditional political institutions and norms.

         <div class="subtitle">Racism and Xenophobia</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">R</span>acism and xenophobia are deeply embedded in far-right ideology, manifesting in fears of the "Great Replacement," a conspiracy theory that claims non-white populations are being intentionally brought into Western countries to replace the native population. This idea fuels anti-immigrant sentiment and is often linked to broader racist and colonialist narratives that view non-Western peoples as inferior or as threats to the cultural and racial purity of Western nations. The far-right's xenophobia is often expressed through policies and rhetoric that seek to restrict immigration, preserve national identity, and reject multiculturalism.

         <div class="subtitle">Climate Change</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">O</span> nce mostly limited to republicans in the United States, climate change denialism is prevalent among leaders of the new right. However, other leaders who acknowledge the danger of climate change but use it to advocate for authoritarian measures to protect the environment, often coupled with racist and xenophobic ideologies, often referred to as ecofascism. This ideology argues that only a strong, ethnically homogenous state can effectively combat environmental degradation, often blaming overpopulation and immigration for ecological crises.
     </br></br>
The perpetrators of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand and the El Paso Walmart shooting in the United States both expressed ecofascist beliefs in their manifestos, linking environmental concerns with xenophobic and racist ideologies.

    <div class="section" id="section2">

<div class="textstandard">
         <div class="subtitle">Gender Ideology</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">N</span> right movements around the world have aggressively opposed what they term "gender ideology," a catch-all phrase used to criticize and delegitimize progressive views on gender identity and sexual orientation. This opposition includes resistance to LGBT rights, with some far-right groups embracing homophobic rhetoric while others adopt a more complex stance, termed "homonationalism" or "homofascism." In this context, some far-right factions co-opt LGBT rights as a symbol of Western superiority while simultaneously marginalizing non-Western cultures and immigrants who are perceived as intolerant of these rights.

<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he ar-right has successfully positioned itself as the champion of "political incorrectness," rebelling against what they perceive as a stifling culture of political correctness enforced by liberal elites. This trend manifests in a deliberate use of provocative language and actions intended to shock and offend, which far-right leaders claim is an exercise of free speech. By rejecting political correctness, the far-right taps into widespread frustration with the perceived moralizing of progressive discourse, appealing to those who feel alienated by the demands for inclusivity and sensitivity.

         <div class="subtitle">Multipolarity</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">F</span>ar-right movements have increasingly embraced the concept of multipolarity, which advocates for a world where power is distributed among multiple sovereign states rather than dominated by a single global hegemon, typically the United States. This shift aligns with their anti-globalist stance and their desire to dismantle the liberal international order. Multipolarity is often presented as a way to preserve national sovereignty and cultural identity in the face of globalization, with far-right leaders supporting alliances with other nationalist governments to counterbalance Western liberal influence.

         <div class="subtitle">Economics</div>
<p class="newspaper"><span class="firstletter">T</span> he far-right's economic playbook is all over the place—at least in their rhetoric. Nationalists talk about pushing for protectionism, shutting down free trade, and pulling back from global engagement. Meanwhile, libertarians, in their speeches, are all about slashing regulations, freeing up the market, and keeping the government out of it. But despite these differences in what they say, they find common ground in their shared narrative that the current system is rigged—a setup, they claim, that’s enriching the elites, eroding national sovereignty, and leaving ordinary people behind.
